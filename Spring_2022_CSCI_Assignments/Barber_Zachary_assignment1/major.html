    <h2>Major events in Computer Science</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was created in 1946.</li>
        <li>ARPANET was established in 1967 creating the first computer network.</li>
        <li>The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>My thoughts</h3>
    These events were important leaps in technology that are still utilized today.<br>
    I find the computer science field to be so fascinating because of the possibility of leaps like these.<br>
    Being able to discover or witness a leap in my lifetime will forever be a long-term goal of mine.
