    <p>I haven't visited many places outside of the state, however, the places I have visited were quite great. It's only the 2 places:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Atlanta, Georgia</li>
        <li>New Orleans, Louisiana (My Personal Favorite)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Atlanta was very enjoyable because I spent time at the Aquarium, CNN Headquarters, and Six Flags. All were really cool to see.</p>
    <p>New Orleans, on the other hand, was very cool for other reasons. Being able to explore the cultures, foods, and languages of New Orleans was such a treat. The jazz, biscuit beignets, and various shops were very different from here in Clarksville.</p>
