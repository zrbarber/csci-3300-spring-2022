    <h1>My Schooling&#127979;</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is <b>Zachary Barber</b>, and I'm currently enrolled at <i>Austin Peay State University (APSU)</i>.
        I am majoring in <b>Computer
            Information Technology (IT)</b> and I spend a great deal of my time building and upgrading computers.
    </p>

    <h1>Spare Time&#128188;</h1>
    <p>
        Making these computers and getting the necessary equipment to do so can get very expensive, however, so I have a
        job on top
        of school. I spend my time making money at <i>Cracker Barrel</i> as a <b>Retail Associate</b>, and I'd say I
        really enjoy my job.
    </p>

    <h1>Career Goal&#128187;</h1>
    <p>
        I really wish to come out of college with a running start at my ideal career. This said career is to be
        somewhere in the
        <b>computer hardware industry</b>, whether it be engineering things, or simply putting it all together.
    </p>
